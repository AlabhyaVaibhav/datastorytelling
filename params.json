How do we find the interesting stories in data, and how do we communicate them in a compelling way, with respect to the data?\r\n\r\n### Logistics\r\n\r\nWe'll be using [github](github.com) to collaborate and share work during this course. Github provides wonderful tools while also reinforcing good software engineering practices.\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\n\r\nWe have seven short weeks to explore!\r\n\r\n**week 0** - Introduction and Philosophy\r\n\r\n* philosophy of data science\r\n* introductions\r\n* ipython, github, and a simple analysis\r\n* homework: [get everything installed](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/install/install.html), work through the bridges and tunnels analysis and commit it to github\r\n\r\n**week 1** - Tools and process\r\n\r\n * is [this graph](http://qz.com/122921/the-chart-tim-cook-doesnt-want-you-to-see/) misleading?\r\n * software engineering process and tools -- how to submit pull requests (and why you would ever want to)\r\n * a few command-line utilities -- grep, awk, wc\r\n * a very simple intro to statistics using NYC restaurant health inspection data\r\n\r\n**week 2** - Acquiring data and process\r\n\r\n * Guest speaker: [Mike Dewar](http://mediaevolution.se/theconference/speaker/mike-dewar/), New York Times R&D\r\n * Let's check out [this animated gif on data viz](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7VHZu1TnnOg/UjdiN9p5NqI/AAAAAAAAKjg/2kEWW2-TNlA/w1280-h920-no/WntrM6p.gif)\r\n * ...and this visualization of NY [Fashion Week](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/09/13/fashion-week-editors-picks/)\r\n * we'll review the first two projects and make sure everyone can commit their code\r\n * let's talk about acquiring data when it's not packaged up so neatly\r\n\r\n**week 3** - Markov Chains and art\r\n\r\n * Guest speaker: [Max Shron](http://shron.net/), Data Strategist\r\n\r\n**week 4** - Algorithms for Data Exploration\r\n\r\n * Guest speaker: [Gilad Lotan](http://giladlotan.com/), Chief Scientist at Betaworks\r\n\r\n**week 5** - Data Product Design\r\n\r\n**week 6** - Final project presentations","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
